# Dice-Game-Arena


🎮 Project Title: Virtual Dice Game Arena

The Virtual Dice Game Arena is a console-based multiplayer dice game that allows 2–4 players to:

Roll a die in turns.

Earn points based on the number rolled.

Apply random game events like “Double Score”, “Lose a Turn”, “Extra Roll”.

Track leaderboard rankings in real-time.

Ends after fixed rounds or target score.

This project is fun, interactive, and demonstrates Java logic, OOPs, randomness, and user input handling.
